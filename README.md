# DNA Nucleotide Analyzer

This is a simple Python project for analyzing DNA sequences.
It counts the frequency of each nucleotide (A, T, G, C) and calculates the GC content.

## Features
- Reads DNA sequences from user input  
- Counts each nucleotide (A, T, G, C)  
- Calculates **GC percentage**  
- Prints the result in a clear format  

## Example Output
insert the DNA sequence: ATGCGGTA
G:3 , A:2 T:2 C:1
GC Percentage is 50.0
## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## File
- `DNA_Analysis.ipynb`

## Future Improvements
- Read from FASTA files  
- Add GC content plot using Matplotlib  
- Use Biopython for sequence analysis
